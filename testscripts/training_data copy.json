a country in the european economic area eea the services are provided by telegram which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our services however as telegram is located outside the eea we have designated a third party european data protection office edpo as our representative pursuant to article of the gdpr you can direct to edpo any of your gdprrelated queries by using edpos online request form at httpsedpocomtelegramgdprdatarequest or by writing to edpo at avenue huart hamoir brussels belgium legal ground for processing your personal data we process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our legitimate interests including providing effective and innovative services to our users and to detect prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our provision of services unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data what personal data we use basic account data telegram is a communication service you provide your mobile number and basic account data which may include profile name profile picture and about information to create a telegram account to make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are the screen name you choose your profile pictures and your username should you choose to set one on telegram are always public we dont want to know your real name gender age or what you like we do not require your screen name to be your real name note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name this way your mother can have the public name johnny depp while appearing as mom to you and as boss to her underlings at work or the other way around depending on how these relationships are structured optional data you can add your birthday with or without the year to your telegram profile if you wish to do so you can granularly choose which users are able to see it on your profile by default your contacts and they will be shown a reminder on the day we may use data about your age to determine your eligibility for accessing agespecific content telegram business subscribers can add a fixed location and a list of opening hours to their profile to help clients identify and engage with their business more efficiently on telegram if you choose to add it to your profile this information is always public your email address when you enable stepverification for your account or store documents using the telegram passport feature you can opt to set up a password recovery email this address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it thats right no marketing or we miss you bullshit from september we may ask some users to provide an email address to receive login codes via email instead of sms with an option to use sign in with google sign in with apple in this case we will receive an email address which will be stored separately from the recovery email and will only be used to send you authentication codes when you log in to your account the login email address will be stored until it is changed or the account is deleted your messages cloud chats telegram is a cloud service we store messages photos videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on thirdparty backups all data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions this way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data secret chats secret chats use endtoend encryption this means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know there is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages we do not store your secret chats on our servers we also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats for the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from media in secret chats when you send photos videos or files via secret chats before being uploaded each item is encrypted with a separate key not known to the server this key and the files location are then encrypted again this time with the secret chats key and sent to your recipient they can then download and decipher the file this means that the file is technically on one of telegrams servers but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient we dont know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to we periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space public chats in addition to private messages telegram also supports public channels and public groups all public chats are cloud chats see section above like everything on telegram the data you post in public communities is encrypted both in storage and in transit but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone paid posts as of june creators are able to offer paid access to specific channel posts by accepting telegram stars when users pay to unlock a channel post a permanent copy is created which resides in the parties transaction history this copy remains accessible even if the post is later deleted or either party loses access to the channel phone number and contacts telegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from sms and other messaging apps and retain your social graph we ask your permission before syncing your contacts we store your uptodate contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for telegram and to properly display names in notifications we only need the number and name first and last for this to work and store no other data about your contacts our automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the approximate number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on telegram when you open the invite friends interface we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining telegram you can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in settings privacy security data settings if you are using android telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs readcalllog if you grant this permission telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log location data if you share a location in a chat this location data is treated like other messages in cloud or secret chats respectively if you share your live location in any chat or turn on make myself visible in people nearby telegram will use your data to display your location to those users with whom you are sharing it even when the app is closed for as long as you keep these optional features activated cookies the only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our services on the web

intruders cannot get access endtoend encrypted data your messages media and files from secret chats see section above as well as the contents of your calls and the data you store in your telegram passport are processed only on your device and on the device of your recipient before this data reaches our servers it is encrypted with a key known only to you and the recipient while telegram servers will handle this endtoend encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient or store it in the case of telegram passport data we have no ways of deciphering the actual information in this case we neither store nor process your personal data rather we store and process random sequences of symbols that have no meaning without the keys which we dont have retention unless stated otherwise in this privacy policy the personal data that you provide us will only be stored for as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill our obligations in respect of the provision of the services processing your personal data our services telegram is a cloud service we will process your data to deliver your cloud chat history including messages media and files to any devices of your choosing without a need for you to use thirdparty backups or cloud storage safety and security telegram supports massive communities which we have to police against abuse and terms of service violations telegram also has more than million users which makes it a lucrative target for spammers to improve the security of your account as well as to prevent spam abuse and other violations of our terms of service we may collect metadata such as your ip address devices and telegram apps youve used history of username changes etc if collected this metadata can be kept for months maximum spam and abuse to prevent phishing spam and other kinds of abuse and violations of telegrams terms of service our moderators may check messages that were reported to them by their recipients if a spam report on a message you sent is confirmed by our moderators your account may be limited from contacting strangers temporarily or permanently you can send an appeal using spambot in case of more serious violations your account may be banned we may also use automated algorithms to analyze messages in cloud chats to stop spam and phishing crossdevice functionality we may also store some aggregated metadata to create telegram features see section below that work across all your devices advanced features we may use some aggregated data about how you use telegram to build useful features for example when you open the search menu telegram displays the people you are more likely to message in a box at the top of the screen to do this we calculate a rating that shows which people you message frequently a similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu or when you start a new message with to turn this feature off and delete the relevant data go to settings privacy security data settings and disable suggest frequent contacts no ads based on user data unlike other services we dont use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes telegram only stores the information it needs to function as a secure and featurerich cloud service telegram offers a tool for advertisers to promote their messages in public onetomany channels but these sponsored messages are based solely on the topic of the public channels in which they are shown no user data is mined or analyzed to display ads or sponsored messages bot messages ecosystem telegram has an api that allows thirdparty developers to create bots bots are apps that look like special telegram users you can talk to them from your chat list add them to groups or use a special inline interface to access their features by performing any of these actions you will be sending some of your data to the respective thirdparty bot developers how bots can receive data you can send data to bot developers when you interact with their bots in one of these ways by sending messages to a bot by using an inline bot by participating in a group with a bot by pressing buttons in messages sent by a bot by paying for goods and services via bots see section below by sending a join request to a group or channel by using telegram business features that connect a chatbot to your account by opening a chat with a telegram business account controlled by a chatbot see section below what data bots receive in any of the above cases the developers of an automated user bot can get your public account data see section above your screen name username and profile pictures bots can also receive the following data when you interact with them bots will obviously get your messages when you send them something if you click on links or buttons provided by the bot the bot can potentially get your ip address provided that it controls the website to which the link leads if the bot is a member of the same group with you it may know you are a member when you start your message with the username of an inline bot eg gif the interface transforms so that everything you type becomes a query to that bot this query is sent to the bot so that it can provide its service we will warn you about this the first time you use an inline bot bots added to groups can operate in two modes with access to messages in the group or without access if the bot has access to messages it can see everything that happens in the group the interface clearly shows whether or not a bot has access to messages in groups to facilitate text localization bots you interact with including via chats managed by telegram business chatbots may receive your interface language based on your app or operating system language settings note that if you update your language settings bots may continue to receive your previous language for some time bots are not maintained by telegram other than our own bots no other bots or thirdparty bot developers are affiliated with telegram they are completely independent from us they should ask you for your permission before they access your data or you make it available to them telegram business chatbots telegram business subscribers can connect thirdparty bots to their telegram account to help them automatically process and respond to messages from users communicating with a business chatbot telegram users have been able to communicate with bots including bots run by businesses since with the introduction of telegram business users can also seamlessly interface with bots in private chats with telegram business users who have connected a chatbot to their account if you message a business user who connected a chatbot to their account depending on their settings you may be effectively communicating with a bot and it will receive basic data about you as detailed in section above using a business chatbot to manage your chats if you connect a thirdparty bot to your account via telegram business the bot will have access to basic information about your account see section above and will be able to message you privately additionally the bot will have access to all messages media and files contained in the private chats you allow it to manage lastly if you grant it permission to do so and only in the private chats you assigned to it the bot will be able to send messages and perform other actions on your behalf you can alter or revoke the bots permissions including the list of chats it can access at any time from settings telegram business chatbots on official telegram clients third party payment services payment information the payment platform for bots is available to users as of telegram telegram does not process payments from users and instead relies on different payment providers around the world it is the payment providers that handle and store your credit card details neither telegram nor the merchants on the platform bot developers have access to this information although we work with payment providers they are completely independent from telegram please study their relevant privacy policies before making your data available to them credit card information when making a purchase you enter your credit card details into a form supplied by the payment provider that will be processing the payment and this information goes directly to the payment providers server your credit card information never reaches telegrams servers we do not access and do not store your credit card information when you save your credit card info it is saved on the respective payment providers servers and the payment provider gives telegram a token that you can reuse for future payments it is not possible to reconstruct your credit card info from the token shipping information when you enter shipping information in the process of placing an order we send it directly to the merchant bot developer we can store your shipping information for you if you choose to save it for future purchases we will delete this information immediately if you ask us to clearing payment information you can clear all payment information associated with your account at any time by going to telegram settings privacy security data settings and selecting clear payment shipping info if you choose to remove your payment information we will delete your stored shipping info and payment tokens from all providers and ask the payment providers to remove your credit card information that they store payment disputes due to

queries are also protected from exposure to rd parties browsing history transferred data we may collect and process personal data about you in the following situations product functionality service data from our vpn servers if you use our vpn service we collect the minimum amount of information needed to provide and operate it as well as keep it running safely and efficiently this is the data we collect to make sure our vpn infrastructure works service data service data what we use it for day of connection eg we store the date you were connected together with an internal identifier but not the exact time timestamps are floored to either am or pm to troubleshoot for support and abuse handling example to know the amount of daily active users rounded amount of data transmitted eg if a user transferred within the session mb we floor it to mb mb of transferred data is floored to mb we keep just the first digit of the value together with an internal identifier to plan for new network

cover your tracks website in general cover your tracks collects anonymous data about the configuration of computers operating systems browsers plugins adblockers and other privacy software if you click the test me buttons this type of information will be collected from your browser although these kinds of data may form a fingerprint that could in principle be combined with information about page requests and identifying details in order to track peoples browsing habits eff will never do so the specific fingerprint information we collect includes the user agent string from each browser the http accept headers sent by the browser screen resolution and color depth the timezone your system is set to the browser extensionsplugins like quicktime flash java or acrobat that are installed in the browser and the versions of those plugins the fonts installed on the computer as reported by flash or java whether your browser executes javascript scripts yesno information saying whether the browser accepts various kinds of cookies and super cookies a hash of the image generated by canvas fingerprinting a hash of the image generated by webgl fingerprinting yesno whether your browser is sending the do not track header your system platform eg win linux x your system language eg enus your browsers touchscreen support other fingerprinting information that indicates which privacy tools you have installed which may include whether your browser makes connections to various thirdparty urls which have characteristics that would typically indicate that they serve advertising analytics or other forms of tracking code the presence or absence of dom elements that indicate the operation or absence of an ad or trackerblocker or whether we believe that your ip address is a tor exit relay or vpn in addition we collect several kinds of housekeeping information to assist us in analyzing the fingerprint data the housekeeping information is cookies encrypted ip addresses timestamps our practices and purposes for collecting these housekeeping records are discussed below cookies cover your tracks sets a cookie that persists for months for the sole purpose of determining how often browser characteristics change and how often they stay the same when a browser returns over time if your browser is configured to accept cookies and you return to cover your tracks several times the cookie will be used to link the data from your visits together ip addresses cover your tracks does not log ip addresses but we do compute cryptographic keyed hashes or hmac s of each ip address using a key which we periodically discard this hashed ip will allow us to collect an anonymous dataset about how often browsers that change ip address could have been followed using a fingerprint for visitors to our website we generally log requests to our website for up to seven days from when the data was collected after stripping the visitors ip address from the request circumstances in which eff may need to log and retain ip addresses and other technical information include when we believe it is reasonably necessary for effs mission and functionality including situations such as site testing diagnosis of technical problems defending against attacks to the site handling a spike in traffic or other abnormal shortterm circumstances timestamps cover your tracks collects a timestamp each time it is visited this will be used to measure how fast browser fingerprints change but for no other purpose effs use of information from cover your tracks in general eff uses the information provided by you to further its mission protect privacy defend freedom and protect your rights in the digital world we may look at technical information to diagnose problems with our server and to administer the cover your tracks website cover your tracks has no thirdparty service providers however if you leave the test with a real tracking company option enabled cover your tracks will use a real resource from a thirdparty tracker for some tests in order to determine whether your ad blocker or privacy tool allows whitelisted resources such as those under the socalled acceptable ads program to unblock those trackers your browser sends very limited information during these test such as a request for a favicon with referrers disabled where possible we believe that in most cases trackers will learn nothing useful from this request though some unblocked trackers might be able to guess you were visiting cover your tracks as a result of it eff uses simulators of third party tracking systems in order to determine whether the visitors browser is protected against similar trackers please note that our simulators may not encompass all the possible ways that a third party
